## What is Vegitto?
#### Vegitto is a community devoted to those in favor of non-meat diets: Vegetarianism and Veganism. It provides its users with a platform (a social media) where they would be able to connect, share their knowledge and support one another in this challenging journey of Veganism.

#### To meet the primary requirements of such a platform, we decided to focus on the most basics, yet necessary features. During this short period, we could build an android app where our users can share their food recipes and view others' shared recipes.

#### Here are some of the main components of our project:

## Classes and Components

### Food.java
#### This class is a model for our food objects. Every food includes many variables such as id, name, ingredient and etc.

#### The food class itself contains two classes: Ingredient and StepRecipe

#### Ingredient
##### This is a model designed to hold an instance of every ingredients of a food.

#### StepRecipe
##### This is basically a model made to hold an instance of each step of a recipe.
